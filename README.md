# ESP8266_Firebase_RTDB
A simple example using the ESP8266 and an Android app to interact with the Google Firebase Realtime Database.

The Android app writes the new state to the db while the ESP reads from the db. The current state is also displayed on the app. This simple example can be used to expand on bigger projects.
